## Configure Pinia

Run this following command to install pinia for nuxt

::block
```bash[bash]
npm i @pinia/nuxt
```
::

After that you need to register this as a module inside `nuxt.config.js`

::block
```js[nuxt.config.js]
modules: [
    [
        "@pinia/nuxt",
        {
        autoImports: ["defineStore", "acceptHMRUpdate", "storeToRefs"],
        },
    ],
],
```
::

Now you can easily create store using pinia like this

::block
```js[store/Root.js]
export const useAuth = defineStore("AuthStore", {
  state: () => ({}),

  getters: {},

  actions: {},
});

```
::

## Configure Pinia Persist

Run this following command in order to install `pinia-plugin-persistedstate` for nuxt3

::block
```bash[bash]
npm i @pinia-plugin-persistedstate/nuxt
```
::

After that you need to register this as module in `nuxt.config.js` and also configure this as well

::block
```js[nuxt.config.js]
modules: [
    "@pinia-plugin-persistedstate/nuxt"
],

piniaPersistedstate: {
    storage: "cookies",
    cookieOptions: {
      path: "/",
      secure: process.env.ENV !== "development",
      domain:
        process.env.ENV !== "development" ? process.env.VUE_APP_DOMAIN : "",
      sameSite: "lax",
    },
  },
```
::

With that you can easily use pinia and pinia persist. See the example below how you can persist state.

::block
```js[store/Auth.js]
export const useAuth = defineStore("AuthStore", {
  state: () => ({
    token: null,
    utmObject: {},
  }),

  persist: {
    key: "auth",
    paths: ["token"],
  },
})
```
::

This will create `auth` cookie and persist `token` state value inside that token.

::alert{type="info"}
**Information:** We have set the storage option to cookies, which is why `piniaPersistedstate` persists the state in cookies.
::

## Migrating Store

Once you configure pinia and pinia persist you need to migrate the store first before anything else. Because all pages, components, layouts are heavily rely on store.
