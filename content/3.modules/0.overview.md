## Overview

In this module, you will learn how to migrate pages, components, layouts, middlewares, and other important aspects. You will also discover how to configure Pinia and persist the Pinia state.

Migrating pages, components, layouts, and middlewares is crucial when transitioning your application to a new version. By migrating these elements, you ensure that your codebase remains compatible with the latest features and enhancements.

When it comes to migrating pages, components, and layouts, you need to update the code to adhere to the changes introduced in the new version. This may involve modifying the file structure, updating imports and exports, and adjusting the syntax or usage based on any new conventions.

Similarly, migrating middlewares requires reviewing and updating the middleware functions to align with the changes in the new version. This may involve adjusting the middleware syntax, making any necessary modifications, and ensuring they are properly registered and used in your application.

Additionally, this module will guide you on how to configure Pinia, a state management solution for Vue applications. Pinia provides a seamless way to manage and share state between components. Migrating Pinia involves updating the configuration files and adapting the state management code to the new version's syntax and APIs.

Furthermore, you will learn how to persist the Pinia state, which ensures that the state data is preserved across page refreshes or application restarts. The module will cover various techniques and strategies to persist the Pinia state.
