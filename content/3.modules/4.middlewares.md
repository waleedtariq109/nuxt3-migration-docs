## Migrate middlewares

Now you need to migrate middlewares. You can see the official nuxt3 documentation about the syntax of middleware. You might see the `redirect()` method for page navigation in nuxt3 middleware this won't work instead you need to use `navigateTo()` method. See example below

::code-group
```js[Not Work]
navigateTo('PATH_HERE')
```
```js[100% Work]
return navigateTo('PATH_HERE')
// or
await navigateTo('PATH_HERE')
```

::alert{type="info"}
**Feel Stuck:** Just ping us on slack 😁

## Important Note

There is one important thing you need to know: you cannot use `useRoute().path` or `useRoute().query` (or the `useRoute()` and `useRouter()` composables in general) inside middleware. This is because it may result in unexpected behavior, such as an infinite loop during route navigation.

Now the question is, what if we need to use the `path`, `query`, or other route property? In that case, we need to use the to and from parameters according to the requirements. See Example Below:

::code-group
```js[Not Recommended]
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware(() => {
  if (useRoute().fullPath === "/") {
    return navigateTo("/investor/dashboard");
  }
});
```
```js[Recommended]
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to, from) => {
  if (to.fullPath === "/") {
    return navigateTo("/investor/dashboard");
  }
});
```
