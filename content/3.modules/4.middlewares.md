## Migrate middlewares

Now you need to migrate middlewares. You can see the official nuxt3 documentation about the syntax of middleware. You might see the `redirect()` method for page navigation in nuxt3 middleware this won't work instead you need to use `navigateTo()` method. See example below

::code-group
```js[Not Work]
navigateTo('PATH_HERE')
```
```js[100% Work]
return navigateTo('PATH_HERE')
// or
await navigateTo('PATH_HERE')
```
::

One more thing I would like to mention is that when you redirect a user from an investor site to an authentication site, you may need to set an external property to true. Here's an example to illustrate this:

::code-group
```js[Not Work]
return navigateTo('AUTH_SITE_URL')
```
```js[100% Work]
return navigateTo('AUTH_SITE_URL', {
  external: true
})
```

## Global Middlewares

In nuxt3 the globall middleware are very easy to implement. You juest need to add `.global` prefix in file name such as `guest.global.js`.

### Usage of Global Middlewares


In Nuxt 2, we add middleware to the layout, but in Nuxt 3, we can no longer add middleware directly to the layout. Instead, middleware is only added to the pages. Therefore, it is important to determine which middleware is used in the layout. For example, if the `auth` middleware is used in the master layout in Nuxt 2, in Nuxt 3, you can make this middleware global by prefixing its filename with global, like `auth.global.js`.

The order of middleware execution in Nuxt 3 is as follows: first, the global middleware is executed, and then the middleware called in the pages is executed. It's important to note that in Nuxt 3, we cannot call middleware in `nuxt.config.js` as we could in Nuxt 2. To achieve similar behavior, you can change the order of middleware execution by prefixing the middleware filename with `0` and so on. For example, if the base middleware was called in nuxt.config.js in Nuxt 2, in Nuxt 3, you would rename it to `0.base.global.js`.

By starting the middleware filename with `0`, you instruct Nuxt to execute this middleware first, followed by the other global middlewares. This allows you to maintain the desired order of middleware execution.

Make sure to update your middleware configuration accordingly when migrating from Nuxt 2 to Nuxt 3, and follow the new guidelines for adding and organizing middleware in your application.

## Important Note

There is one important thing you need to know: you cannot use `useRoute().path` or `useRoute().query` (or the `useRoute()` and `useRouter()` composables in general) inside middleware. This is because it may result in unexpected behavior, such as an infinite loop during route navigation.

Now the question is, what if we need to use the `path`, `query`, or other route property? In that case, we need to use the to and from parameters according to the requirements. See Example Below:

::code-group
```js[Not Recommended]
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware(() => {
  if (useRoute().fullPath === "/") {
    return navigateTo("/investor/dashboard");
  }
});
```
```js[Recommended]
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to, from) => {
  if (to.fullPath === "/") {
    return navigateTo("/investor/dashboard");
  }
});
```
